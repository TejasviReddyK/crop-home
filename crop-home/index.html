      <h1>Farmer-friendly</h1>
      <p><i>Crop-Home</i> is fully committed to the <strong>welfare of the farmer</strong>.
      <p>India was once largely a country dependant on agriculture. But, due to changing times and industrialization, today the focus of the policy-makers has shifted away from agriculture. Today, farmers are facing an extremely difficult time. Rising suicide rates among farmers in the country show the severity of the problem.</p>
	  <p>At <i>Crop-Home</i>, we are working to change this. We want to prevent farmer suicides altogether, and give the farmer a reason to pick up his plough and start tilling his land.</p>

    <h1>How Crop-Home helps farmers</h1>
<p>Most crops, especially rice, require a lot of care and substantial financial investment over the growing season. The initial costs themselves—the seed cost, manure and fertilizer costs—are so high, that most farmers have to take loans. As the season progresses, more and more expenditures are incurred such as labour costs, fertilizer and manure costs, irrigation costs and the cost of protecting the crop.</p>

<p>When the crop has been harvested, and it's time to sell it, the farmers look towards middle-men to sell the harvested crop. These middle-men, who are profit-driven, offer to buy at rates that don't fully compensate the farmer for his efforts and the costs incurred. The farmers having no other alternative, have to sell their crop at a loss-price.

<p>Some farmers choose to retain their crop till they get a suitable price for their crop. This is where the farmers who are generally not equipped to handle storage, incur more losses. Pests and weather cause losses, sometimes so severe, that farmers are driven to desperation and deciding to cut losses, sell their produce at an even lower price. Unable to pay back the borrowed money and needing more money for the next growing season, they sink deeper and deeper into debt. It's a vicious circle.
<h2>An age-old tradition</h2>
<p>For most farmers, agriculture isn't simply a means to a living. It's a way of life, passed down through the generations and deeply rooted in the culture.</p>
<p>Every one in the household shares a strong bond with the land. This is evident in how the overall state of the household reflects the state of the crop. The sowing season brings hope and optimism of a new start. The household is full of feverish activity and every one in the household lends a hand with planting the seeds. When the crop is growing and about to mature, the farmer worries about his crop incessantly. He worries about protecting his crop from pests and disease. Members of the household take turns watching the crop, even at night. During this time, everyone's generally anxious. Finally, when the crop has matured and is ready to be harvested, there is more feverish activity as again every one in the family lends a hand with the harvesting. Everything in their lives is based around the land on which they cultivate the crops. It is an intensely personal endeavour and a lot depends on every crop.
  <p>And after all this effort over the season, if the harvest doesn't fetch a sustainable price or if the losses are severe, the farmer cannot pay back the loans and still left needing more money for the next season.

<h2>How Crop-Home helps</h2>
<p>Crop-Home helps the farmers by removing the hassle of storage and the worry of selling his harvest at a sustainable price.
  <p>As soon as the farmer informs us that he is ready to sell, Crop-Home visits him and once we confirm that the required quality guidelines have been met, we buy the crop from the farmer. The price is calculated based on the costs that the farmer has incurred over the season and also includes a compensation for his efforts over the season. By selling the crop as soon as it is ready, the farmer doesn't have to store it for any period of time and thus protected from the losses he would have incurred during storage. We aim to make the whole process as easy as possible for the farmer, eliminating any worries, leaving him free to do what he does best and raise a high quality crop.</p>
